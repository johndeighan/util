to do

continue expanding build_all_libs

document lib console-utils

use console-utils everywhere in place of logger

return logger, log-formatter, log-levels

continue documenting datatypes lib

in source-map's mapSourcePos, if there's directory info
in the input parameter, but not in the mapped object
- add it

setDirTree() still doesn't work correctly
causing fsys.lib.test.civet to fail
(fsys now passes with some tests removed)

unit test pass until pll, which fails because
of the problem with setDirTree()

write and test getBlock() in section-map.lib.civet
test with TAML input

fsys has a working openTextFile()
use it to enhance hera-compile to allow meta-data
	---
	lang: 'civet'
	---

to convert all code from civet to TypeScript

??? if a rule body has no ->, automatically add
return $0 along with the ruleMatch() call

continue using src/parse/dir-tree.parse.ts
to create new src/parse/dir-tree.parse.hera

work out how to create and install a command

use 'utest <stub>' to run unit tests
	- cmd-args unit test fails

	::=      defines a type
